# Traffic-sign-recognition
### Intro
- Implemented Feed Forward Network with 6 convolutional layers followed by a fully connected hidden layer in Keras to recognize 43 different traffic signs and finally got 96% accuracy. 
- Training set includes about 39000 images while test set has around 12000 images.
- Enhanced the performance of this CNN to 98% accuracy by replacing the model with VGG-16 model.
